This is vim python ide plugins set.

To function well you must put .vim folder togetother with file .vimrc

under your home root directory!

If you want to use taglists and ctags you must install it first

and set ctags path through which "ctags"  match your .vimrc

catgs line  "let Tlist_Ctags_cmd='/usr/bin/ctags' "


That is all for vim config 

do enjoy it !
